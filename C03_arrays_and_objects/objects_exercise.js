/* For this exercise, your task is to create a new JavaScript object that should be stored in the courseData variable.

The to-be-created object must have three properties:

title => a string (must be "JavaScript - The Complete Guide")

duration => a positive number of your choice (e.g., 30)

levels => an array with exactly two elements (must be "Beginner" and "Advanced")

You don't have to do anything else with the object - just create it and make sure the data mentioned above is stored correctly.*/

let courseData = {
    title: 'JavaScript - The Complete Guide',
    duration: 30,
    levels: ['Beginner','Advanced']
}
