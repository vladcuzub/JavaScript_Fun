/* For this exercise, your task is to set the value of the already-defined userCategory variable conditionally. The value for userCategory should depend on the value stored in age:

If age is smaller than 18, userCategory should be set to 'child'

For ages between 18 and 65 (18 included, 65 excluded), userCategory should be 'adult'

For all other ages, userCategory should be 'senior'

Make sure to put all your conditional code into the pre-defined solve() function - otherwise the automatic solution checking won't work.
