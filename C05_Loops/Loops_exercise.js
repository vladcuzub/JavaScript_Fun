/* Exercise: for Loops
For this exercise, you should create a for loop that runs 100 times. In every run, the pre-defined callMe() function should be executed. Therefore, by the end of the loop, callMe() should have been called 100 times.

Important: Put your loop code into the existing solve() function to ensure that the automatic solution checking works as intended.*/

function callMe() {
    console.log('Called!');
}

function solve() {
    for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
        callMe()
    }
}
